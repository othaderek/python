# Python

This is a collection of some python projects, some complete and some in
progress. My goal WAS to commit one program a day for the next year, but alas that has failed.
Currently working on my Ruby and will switch back to my Python programming after I get the hang
of it.

## UPDATE:

The one program a day thing didn't really work out obviously however..
I have since completed a 15 week bootcamp at Access Labs where I learned Ruby, Javascript, and React
I am still trying to reach mastery in Javascript currently (whatever that means), but have a desire
to catch up on my Python aspirations. So this will be where I put python stuff from now on.

Thanks for reading!
